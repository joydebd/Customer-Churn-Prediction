# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Predicting whether a customer will change telecommunications provider, something known as "churning".

The training dataset contains 4250 samples. Each sample contains 19 features and 1 boolean variable "churn" which indicates the class of the sample. 

The models used include:

1.K Nearest Neighbors - fast, simple and instance-based

2.Logistic Regression - fast and linear model

3.Random Forest - slower but accurate ensemble model based on decision trees

4.Support Vector Machines - slower but accurate model used here in the non-linear form-

Find out the best model in terms of test accuracy, defined as follows:

Accuracy=Number of correctly predicted test samples /Total number of test samples
